OSWP Notes:


Mesh Peering Management (MPM): Unsecure peering
- Unencrypted and rogue stations may hijack connections.

Authenticated Mesh Peering Exchange (AMPE): Secure peering.
- Use's simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) or 802.1x to exchange encryption keys.

To see other Wi-Fi networks we require monitoring mode for our wireless card to be enabled,
this allows us to capture 802.11 frames and allow packet injection.

Wi-Fi Encryption-----

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) can be cracked in under a minute.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)

WPA3 (2018)
- Uses forward secrecy, using a Dragonfly handshake with SAE.
- Simplify process of configuring devices with no display such as IoT
- A new 192-bit mode for eneterprise networks with stronger cipher suites.
- Mandatory use of protected management frames (PMF)

Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) also known as "Enhanced Opened" adds encryption to public Wi-Fi networks.

Open networks do not involve any encryption so anyone running a wireless sniffer can see the traffic "as is".
This process of connecting to the network is as follows:

The client sends an authentication request to the AP
The AP sends an authentication response of "successful"
The STA sends an association request to the access point
The AP sends an association response if the capability of the clients meets that of the AP

WPA encryption comes in two flavors:

WPA Personal: Makes use of pre-shared key authentication (WPA-PSK), a passphrase shared by all peers of the network.
WPA Enterprise: Uses 802.1X and a Radius server for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

Without 802.11w when sending a DeAuth, the AP or one or all clients blindly accepts it and disconnects.

In most cases the client will reconnect automatically without the user knowing. A 4 way handshake will happen,
which can later be cracked offline. It is also useful for attacks against WEP.
